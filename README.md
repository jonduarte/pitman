# Pitman

A simple command line tool to help users find unused gems.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem install pitman
```

And then execute:

    $ pitman <DIR> # DIR must be the main directory where you place all your ruby projects.


## TODO

* Verify gems based on `ruby` version (because user could've multiple ruby versions, therefore the gem listing must respect the intended ruby version of that project).
